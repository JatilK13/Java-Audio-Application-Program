Audio Application Simulator

This audio application program stores and manages audio content of various types (including songs, audio books, and podcasts) in a library. Audio content can be downloaded 
from a simulated online store. The audio content in the library can be played (in this app, playing a song means printing its lyrics). Playlists can store mixtures of different 
types of audio content.
